  <h1>Personal Life</h1>
  <p>Originally from a small town in Maine, I have lived in Washington D.C., Austin and now in LA. I am the youngest of six children with five older sisters. Speaking of children, I have a son, Milo, with my amazing and wonderful partner.</p>
  <br>
  <p>When I'm not working I enjoy spending time with my family, reading and working on side projects. I also enjoy playing basketball and rock climbing.</p>
  <h1>Professional Life</h1>
  <h3>University of Maine Orono</h3>
  <h6> Bachelor of Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Minor in Mathematics</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>I completed a five-year program in three years. I regret not trying to triple major in three years.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</h3>
  <h6>Nuclear Shift Test Engineer</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>I completed a two-year training program to become a certified Nuclear Shift Test Engineer (STE). Afterward, I directed a team of Navy and Shipyard personal to conduct maintenance and testing on Nuclear systems. The most exciting part was directing a startup and increase to 100% power of a nuclear reactor and riding in a submarine from England to the US.</p>
  <br>
  <p>However, the work/life balance and working conditions for an STE are quite unpleasant, so I became a trainer.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I trained people to do the job I didn't enjoy doing.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</h3>
  <h6>Reactor Operations Engineer</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>I went through a six-month training program to qualify as a Reactor Operations Engineer. Afterword I read a lot of documents, went to a lot of meetings and realized I was not meant for government work.</p>
  <br>
  <p>One day while at work, I read that Actuary was the most desirable job. The only requirement: be good at Math. I started to study for the Society of Actuary exams.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A different day while at work, I came up with an idea for a fitness application: personalized and unique daily workouts based on the user's goals. "How hard could it be to build an application? I took a few programming classes in college," I thought. Famous last words before I started the journey to create it.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Society of Actuary Exams</h3>
  <h6>Probability and Financial Mathematics</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>I studied for and passed two Society of Actuary exams. I was ready to apply for jobs.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Southern New Hampshire University</h3>
  <h6>Master's Degree, Finance</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>I was dismayed to discover the job market was very competitive. I enrolled in graduate school to give myself a better chance at getting a job as an Actuary.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>SigningDay</h3>
  <h6>Software Engineer</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>Plot twist: while working on my fitness app idea, I fell in love with programming. Seven months after I initially had the idea, I had a Software Engineering job at a start-up.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I used Python to build a web scraper; Javascript with Angular, PhoneGap and a house-rolled framework to maintain a web/native application and API; Java with the Play framework to re-write the Javascript application. I setup Linode servers to run and monitor our applications, my first exposure to DevOps.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>DraftCrunch</h3>
  <h6>CTO (de-facto)</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>They said I would be working with two other engineers. They both quit before I started. I had two-days of turnover and then I was responsible for everything tech.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I drank from a firehose seven days a week. I had to learn about query optimization, AWS, CSS frameworks, mobile responsiveness, CI/CD pipelines, multiple API frameworks, Wordpress and more.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The two other engineers knew something I didn't: the runway was short. One and a half months short. I worked five months for free and got a second job as a Teaching Assistant to cover part of my bills.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Trilogy Education</h3>
  <h6>Teaching Assistant</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>I trained people to do the job I enjoy doing.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Dun &amp; Bradstreet</h3>
  <h6>Software Engineer</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>I went from two start-ups that were less than two years old to a company that employed Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Grover Cleveland and William McKinley. Things were different here, to say the least. First of all, I was on a team with more than three people. Scrum meetings, product/project managers and pull requests/code reviews, to name a few things, were all new to me.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I learned. I adapted. I thrived.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I converted three separate repos to a mono-repo to improve developer efficiency and flexibility. I planned and started an upgrade from Angular to React. I implemented End-to-End testing using CodeceptJS and then trained QA Engineers on how to write the tests (QA was previously done manually). I organized a weekly developer training for Engineers to learn from each other. I worked with Angular, React, Java, Jenkins, AWS, CodeceptJS, Wordpress, PHP and more.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Headspace</h3>
  <h6>Senior DevOps Engineer</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>A growth start-up with a noble mission: To Improve the Health and Happiness of the World. At the time I applied there was only one Engineering position listed on their website: DevOps Engineer. Something I had limited experience with. I applied anyways.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I got the job.</p>
  <br>
  <p>What is service discovery? What is a service mesh? What is the difference between provisioning and configuration? These terms were foreign to me. After being immersed into DevOps these, and many other, terms are now second nature.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I lead a migration from a single to multiple AWS accounts. I lead the migration of our secret store from Credstash to AWS Parameter Store. I helped decentralized DevOps to give developers more ownership and access to their infrastructure. I have implemented security tools to deter malicious users.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Georgia Tech</h3>
  <h6>Master's Degree, Computer Science - Machine Learning Specialization (Starts Fall 2020)</h6>
  <hr>
  <p>This is for personal gratification and preparation for the future.</p>

dive deep into story points and explain why I believe <em>complexity</em> is the most effective way to use story points and
the value it delivers to your team.</p><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/story_points_explained.jpeg alt="Story Points Explained"></p></p><hr><h2 id=what-are-story-points>What are Story Points? <a href=#what-are-story-points class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><p>In the simplest terms Story Points are a unit of measure.</p><p>They are used by engineering teams to <em>estimate</em> the effort required to complete a piece of work. Teams will
use techniques such as planning poker to assign a point estimate to each task. From these estimates teams can
determine a velocity (i.e. how many points they complete per sprint) and estimate how long larger projects will take.</p><p>Before story points teams used time to estimate how long it would take to complete a task, but this had several pitfalls&mldr;</p><h2 id=whats-wrong-with-time>What&rsquo;s wrong with time? <a href=#whats-wrong-with-time class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><h4 id=hard-to-estimate>Hard to Estimate <a href=#hard-to-estimate class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>Generally speaking people are overly optimistic about how much work they can get done within a givin amount of time. This
is true of developers as well.</p><blockquote><p>Hofstadter&rsquo;s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&rsquo;s Law.</p></blockquote><p>Software Engineering is inherently a complex field and contains a lot of known-unknowns and unknown-unknowns - either
of this will quickly ruin an estimate based on time.</p><h4 id=doesnt-account-for-different-ability-levels>Doesn&rsquo;t Account for Different Ability Levels <a href=#doesnt-account-for-different-ability-levels class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>If your team is made up of junior and senior engineers it is likely a task will take the junior engineer longer than
the senior. When it comes to estimating tickets, which perspective do you use? This leads to the person doing the ticket
also creating the estimate, however, if that person has to leave unexpectedly then it throws your planning off.</p><h4 id=masks-value-of-work>Masks Value of Work <a href=#masks-value-of-work class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>When using time as a means to estimate work it gives equal credit to low-value repetitive work as it does to high-value
complicated work. Most companies want their brightest people solving their hardest problems - not doing a repetitive
manual task that takes 40 hours. When using time as a basis for story points it is unclear if the team is solving
your biggest challenges.</p><h4 id=hides-capacity-to-do-more>Hides Capacity To Do More <a href=#hides-capacity-to-do-more class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>When using a time based approach there are only two ways to increase the capacity of your team: add more people or
work more overtime. Otherwise your capacity is fixed over time (i.e. 40 hours/week). However,
as your team continues to improve their skills and gain experience their capacity to handle complexity will increase. A
junior developer will spend more time doing a complicated task today then they will after having two years of experience. When using time as a basis for story points it will not reval this increased capacity of the team.</p><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/time_based_story_points.png alt="Time Based Points"></p></p><hr><h2 id=use-complexity>Use Complexity <a href=#use-complexity class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><p>When you base story points on complexity instead of time all of these issues go away. Lets take a look&mldr;</p><h4 id=easy-to-estimate>Easy to Estimate <a href=#easy-to-estimate class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>With complexity based story points you are ranking the stories based on how complex they are relative to each other. When taking this approach it becomes easier for people to categorize issues. Complexity based points don&rsquo;t require you to be as precise as time based estimates. As we all know, when you make an <em>estimate</em> as an engineer you are held to it, therefore, you put a lot of time debating something will take 4 or 6 hours. With complexity there is no need to be precise, you only need to know that a given task is more or less complex than something you have done previously.</p><h4 id=ability-level-unimportant>Ability Level Unimportant <a href=#ability-level-unimportant class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>The ability levels of the engineers on your team do not factor into the estimates when using complexity as a basis for story points . Whether you are a junior or senior you would agree implementing an API is more complex than creating a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application. Once someone gets acclimated to your team they will have a good feel on whether a given task is more or less complex than one done previously.</p><h4 id=displays-value-of-work>Displays Value of Work <a href=#displays-value-of-work class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>Repetitive tasks that take a long time typically have a low complexity. If your team is doing a bunch of this type of
work it will reveal itself in how many points got completed at the end of the sprint. Tasks that are complex and require
your engineers to solve them will have a greater value and reflect a higher velocity.</p><h4 id=demonstrates-capacity-to-do-more>Demonstrates Capacity To Do More <a href=#demonstrates-capacity-to-do-more class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>As members on your team get more acclimated to the codebase and gain more experience you would expect them to be able
to accomplish tasks of the same complexity in less time. If it took a developer five hours to do a five story point task
six months ago it should take them less time to do the same task today. What you&rsquo;ll see is the velocity of the team increases over time. However, it is not because your team added new people or worked over time, it is because they
have more experience and skills that enable them to solve problems faster.</p><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/complexity_based_points.png alt="Complexity Based Points"></p></p><p>It is important to keep the task complexity constant over time unless the task has become inherently less complicated. For example, if adding a new API endpoint is three points today it will be three points six months from now. The complexity
of the task doesn&rsquo;t change because the team members have more experience/skills and are able to complete it in less
time.</p><blockquote><p>It is important to keep task complexity constant over time (unless the task has become less complicated)</p></blockquote><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/increase_in_capacity.png alt="Increase in Capacity"></p></p><p>However, if you make a task inherently less complicated by creating an automation, a library, or a module, etc then
you have created <em>leverage</em> and reduced the complexity of the task the next time you do it. The initial implementation
may have been five points but every subsequent time you need to do it the task will only be one point because of the
leverage you created.</p><hr><h2 id=common-pitfalls>Common Pitfalls <a href=#common-pitfalls class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><h4 id=treating-story-points-as-precise-measures>Treating Story Points as Precise Measures <a href=#treating-story-points-as-precise-measures class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>I&rsquo;ve been on teams where story points are treated as precise measures rather than rough estimates. They will have a
spreadsheet that will track how many days a developer plans to take off, points completed per developer per day, etc. Then
they will analyze the spreadsheet after every sprint and talk about discrepancies of a few points or less.</p><p>The basis behind using story points and the fibonacci sequence is for the measures to be <strong>imprecise</strong> and <strong>relative</strong>. If story
points were meant to be precise we would use all of the numbers and revert back to time estimates. Splitting hairs on minor deviations or treating the <strong>estimates</strong> as precise measures is a futile effort.</p><h4 id=confusing-effort-with-time>Confusing Effort With Time <a href=#confusing-effort-with-time class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>The definitions of effort are:</p><ol><li>The use of physical or mental energy to do something; exertion.</li><li>A difficult exertion of strength or will.</li><li>A usually earnest attempt.</li></ol><p>I&rsquo;ve seen teams conflate effort with time. They may have a chart that says if a task will take ~1 day of effort then
the task is two story points. However, effort is more related to complexity than it is time. I could do a mundane
task that takes three days and expend very little effort because it is easy. Or I could expend a lot of effort
on a complex problem and solve it in four hours.</p><p>By conflating effort with time you revert back to basing your story points based on time.</p><h4 id=trying-to-do-math-with-the-numbers>Trying To Do Math With The Numbers <a href=#trying-to-do-math-with-the-numbers class=anchor>🔗</a></h4><p>Are 13 one-point tickets the same complexity as one 13-point ticket?</p><p><em>The answer in no.</em></p><p>A misconception I see frequently is people using math with story points and assuming a two-point ticket
is twice as complex as a one-point ticket. This isn&rsquo;t the case nor is it the point of story points. They are
used to weight relative complexity but doing the same repetitive task 144 times is not the same as
implementing a multi-cloud architecture.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div id=social><a class=symbol href=https://github.com/gabel7r rel=me target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" viewBox="0 0 72 72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>Github</title><desc>Created with Sketch.</desc><defs/><g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Social-Icons---Rounded-Black" transform="translate(-264.000000, -939.000000)"><g id="Github" transform="translate(264.000000, 939.000000)"><path d="M8 72H64c4.418278.0 8-3.581722 8-8V8c0-4.418278-3.581722-8-8-8H8c-4.418278 811624501e-24-8 3.581722-8 8V64c541083001e-24 4.418278 3.581722 8 8 8z" id="Rounded" fill="#bbb"/><path d="M35.9985 13C22.746 13 12 23.7870921 12 37.096644c0 10.6440272 6.876 19.6751861 16.4145 22.8617681C29.6145 60.1797862 30.0525 59.4358488 30.0525 58.7973276 30.0525 58.2250681 30.0315 56.7100863 30.0195 54.6996482c-6.6765 1.4562499-8.085-3.2302544-8.085-3.2302544-1.0905-2.7829884-2.664-3.5239139-2.664-3.5239139C17.091 46.4500754 19.4355 46.4801943 19.4355 46.4801943c2.4075.1701719 3.675 2.4833051 3.675 2.4833051 2.142 3.6820383 5.6175 2.6188404 6.9855 2.0014024C30.3135 49.4077535 30.9345 48.3460615 31.62 47.7436831 26.2905 47.1352808 20.688 45.0691228 20.688 35.8361671c0-2.6308879.9345-4.781379 2.4705-6.4665327C22.911 28.7597262 22.0875 26.3110578 23.3925 22.9934585c0 0 2.016-.6475568 6.6 2.4697516C31.908 24.9285993 33.96 24.6620468 36.0015 24.6515052 38.04 24.6620468 40.0935 24.9285993 42.0105 25.4632101c4.581-3.1173084 6.5925-2.4697516 6.5925-2.4697516C49.9125 26.3110578 49.089 28.7597262 48.8415 29.3696344 50.3805 31.0547881 51.309 33.2052792 51.309 35.8361671c0 9.2555448-5.6115 11.29309-10.9575 11.8894446.860999999999997.7439374 1.629 2.2137408 1.629 4.4621184C41.9805 55.4089489 41.9505 58.0067059 41.9505 58.7973276 41.9505 59.4418726 42.3825 60.1918338 43.6005 59.9554002 53.13 56.7627944 60 47.7376593 60 37.096644 60 23.7870921 49.254 13 35.9985 13" fill="#fff"/></g></g></g></svg></a><a class=symbol href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabelevasseur/ rel=me target=_blank><svg width="28" height="28" fill="#bbb" viewBox="0 0 500 500"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><rect width="500" height="500" fill="#bbb" rx="50"/><path fill="#fff" d="M154.703 100.183c-19.121.0-34.689 15.565-34.703 34.701.0 19.136 15.568 34.704 34.703 34.704 19.128.0 34.688-15.568 34.688-34.704.0-19.134-15.561-34.701-34.688-34.701zm26.045 83.348h-52.094a4.488 4.488.0 00-4.488 4.489v167.675a4.488 4.488.0 004.488 4.488h52.093a4.49 4.49.0 004.489-4.488V188.02a4.486 4.486.0 00-4.488-4.489zm133.176-1.974c-19.064.0-35.817 5.805-46.04 15.271v-8.808c0-2.48-2.01-4.489-4.489-4.489h-49.971a4.489 4.489.0 00-4.489 4.489v167.675a4.488 4.488.0 004.489 4.488h52.044a4.49 4.49.0 004.489-4.488v-82.957c0-23.802 4.378-38.555 26.227-38.555 21.526.026 23.137 15.846 23.137 39.977v81.535a4.489 4.489.0 004.49 4.488h52.068a4.489 4.489.0 004.488-4.488v-91.977c-.001-38.253-7.553-82.161-66.443-82.161z"/></g></svg></a></div><div class=copyright>© Copyright

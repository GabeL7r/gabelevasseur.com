This includes low-level issues such as formatting and identifier naming, but also issues such as how modules and classes are designed, etc.

which is necessary for the sake of logic, accuracy, or fairness.</p></blockquote><p>However, as I did more research I came to realize that consistency is a subset of Conceptual Integrity much in the same way that User Interface (UI) Design is a subset of User Experience (UX) Design.</p><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/UI-vs-UX-ketchup_2017_02.jpeg alt="UI vs UX"></p>In fact, UX Design is the perfect analogy for Conceptual Integrity. Webflow defines UX Design as:</p><blockquote><p>UX design mainly involves research to understand things like customer pain points, potential market gaps, and competitor analysis. Besides focusing on a deep understanding of users and unmet market needs, UX also takes into account the business goals and objectives to build products that align with the company‚Äôs visions and missions. UX best practices improve user interactions and perceptions of products and services as desired by the company.</p><p>Source: <a href=https://webflow.com/blog/ux-vs-ui-design target=_blank rel=noopener>Webflow</a></p></blockquote><p>If we make a few subtle change to the definition for UX, we can arrive at a definition for Conceptual Integrity:</p><blockquote><p>Conceptual Integrity mainly involves research to understand things like developer pain points, potential technological gaps, and tool/framework analysis. Besides focusing on a deep understanding of developers and unmet technological needs, Conceptual Integrity also takes into account the business goals and objectives to build products that align with the company‚Äôs visions and missions. Conceptual Integrity best practices improve developer interactions and perceptions of systems as desired by the company.</p></blockquote><p>Consistency is a part of Conceptual Integrity as it helps to improve a developers interaction and perceptions of systems, but Conceptual Integrity takes into account much more than that.</p><p>Conceptual Integrity asks questions such as:</p><ul><li>Will the developer experience be smooth, seamless, and intuitive, or is it confusing and unwieldy?</li><li>Does using certain tooling/frameworks allow developers to work more efficiently?</li><li>Which architectural patterns should be used and which avoided?</li><li>How quickly are developers able to start productively contributing to the system?</li><li>How will we release new features to our customers?</li></ul><p>The same way UX Design aims to improve customer satisfaction, Conceptual Integrity will improve developer satisfaction.</p><p>Now that we have a common understanding of what it means, lets look at why it is so important.</p><hr><h3 id=why-is-it-important>‚ùóWhy is it important? <a href=#why-is-it-important class=anchor>üîó</a></h3><p>The importance of Conceptual Integrity is very clear in <a href=https://hmcarchitects.com/news/emergency-department-design-for-a-more-efficient-and-safe-er-2019-02-27/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Emergency Departments designs</a>. Emergency Departments are literally a matter of life or death. They need to accommodate many factors including security, patient waiting time, safety, up/down staffing and shift changes, and staff effectiveness when treating patients. If Emergency Departments were poorly designed (i.e. lacked Conceptual Integrity) it could have significant consequences. For example, think about how hard it would be for doctors to do their job if each Emergency Room stored supplies in different or random locations. Luckily, each room has a standardized layout so the staff knows exactly where to find the tools that they need and can treat patients with ease no matter which room they are in.</p><p>Luckily, most software developers don&rsquo;t work in Emergency Rooms so lives are not on the line. However, the survival of your company could be. Let&rsquo;s look at the negative consequences for systems that do not have Conceptual Integrity.</p><h4 id=developer-attrition>Developer Attrition <a href=#developer-attrition class=anchor>üîó</a></h4><p>What happens if you have a poor UX design? Your conversion rates decrease. Your users drop-off and stop using your product. Your users find alternatives.</p><p>Well, the same thing happens with developers!</p><p>Legacy/Tech Debt (i.e. code that does not have Conceptual Integrity) is one of the <a href=https://www.shakebugs.com/blog/quitting-software-engineering/ target=_blank rel=noopener>reasons software engineers look for new jobs</a>. Developers do not enjoy working on systems that are not easy to work on and with such a high demand for their talents they are able to change jobs at will.</p><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/wtf.webp alt=WTF></p></p><ul><li>More expensive to onboard new engineers (lost productivity in onboarding and peering/pairing)

Code formatting is easy, we can automate it. Conceptual Integrity is harder to maintain when there is no automation to enforce consistency.</p><h5 id=style-guides>Style Guides <a href=#style-guides class=anchor>üîó</a></h5><p><a href=https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#language-features target=_blank rel=noopener>Google</a> and <a href=https://github.com/airbnb/javascript target=_blank rel=noopener>AirBnB</a> have written exhaustive JavaScript style guides to reduce the amount of &ldquo;options&rdquo; available to developers. Their style guides make opinionated decisions based on performance and readability improvements. By creating a style guide and sharing it everyone enforcing conceptual integrity becomes a shared responsibility.</p><p>Here is an example from the AirBnB style guide:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-javascript data-lang=javascript><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e>// 4.3 Use array spreads ... to copy arrays.

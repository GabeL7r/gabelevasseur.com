title: "Writing - It's not THAT important"
description: "Dispelling a lifelong misconception."

I took AP English during my junior year of High School. I still remember taking the AP exam. Looking up at the clock and seeing there was still an hour left to finish the test; looking down and seeing my pencil on my desk. The sound of pencils as my classmates frantically worked on their essays. Wondering if I had a chance of passing the exam since I was the only one done.

Later that summer I got a letter from the College Board, it was the results. I "passed" with a three out of five. Good enough to be accepted for college credit at the university I attended.

The last English class I ever took was my senior year of High School. English was never particularly captivating to me. I questioned why I had to read The Great Gatsby and try to infer the symbolism behind colors. "I'm good at math and I'm going to be an Engineer or Mathematician, writing is not THAT important." my inner voice would say out loud.

It has been some time since High School and I have had two successful Engineering careers, without ever attempting to become a better writer. I always considered myself a slightly above-average writer. Once in awhile I would miss commas. I never REALLY understood when to use a semi-colon. Overall though, I did well enough. At the very least, my writing was not holding me back.

Recently I noticed I needed to improve how I express my ideas, at work and in my personal life. Realizing this, I came up with a plan to improve: become a better writer to become a better speaker. I went to Coursera and searched for writing classes. "Good with Words," sounds great, I signed up. I expected the material to be similar to High School: not interesting and hard to grasp.

I did not expect after a few hours of going through the course I .

I quickly realized the power of words when you know how to use the right ones effectively. It is no longer an option to "get by" with my current writing skills, I have to get better if I want to have a more successful career. The impact is far-reaching: my LinkedIn page, my resume, technical specifications, emails, the list goes on.

This blog is the beginning of my journey to becoming a better writer.

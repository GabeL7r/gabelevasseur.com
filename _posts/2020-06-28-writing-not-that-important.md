description: "Dispelling a lifelong misconception."

I took AP English during my junior year of High School. I still remember taking the AP exam. The sounds of my peer's pencils as they were frantically writing their essays. Looking up at the clock and seeing there was still an hour left to finish the test; looking down and seeing my pencil on my desk. Wondering if I had any chance of passing the exam since I was the only one done.

I "passed" with a three out of five. Good enough to be accepted for college credit at the university I attended.

The last English class I ever took was my senior year of High School. I never found English classes particularly captivating. I questioned why it was important to read The Great Gatsby and determine the symbolism behind the colors mentioned in the book. "I'm good at math and I'm going to be an Engineer or Mathematician, how does this help me?" my inner voice would say out loud.

It has been some time since High School and I have had two successful Engineering careers, without ever attempting to become a better writer. I always considered myself a slightly above-average writer. Once in awhile I would miss commas. I never REALLY understood when to use a semi-colon. Overall though, I did well enough. At the very least, my writing was not holding me back.

Over the past few years, I have realized that I sometimes have difficulty explaining the ideas I have in a clear way to others. It would take me a few iterations for someone to see the way I was thinking. Observing this, I came up with a plan to improve: become a better writer to become a better speaker. I went to Coursera and searched for writing classes. "Good with Words," sounds great, sign me up. I expected the material to be similar to High School: not interesting and hard to grasp.

> Become a better writer to become a better speaker

Mind Blown.

I quickly realized the power of words when you know how to use the right ones effectively. It is no longer an option to "get by" with my current writing skills, I have to get better if I want to have a more successful career. The impact is far-reaching: my LinkedIn page, my resume, technical specifications, emails, the list goes on.

This blog is the beginning of my journey to becoming a better writer.

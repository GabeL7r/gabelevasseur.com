Title Lint enforces standards for Pull Request titles. This can be extremely beneficial if you have an integration between your ticketing system and GitHub that depends on having a ticket number in the Pull Request to link to. It also helps if you use tools such as conventional commit or the recently released Automatic Release Notes generator by GitHub.

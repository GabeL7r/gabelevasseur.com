summary: "PR Too Big enforces small Pull Requests to improve Engineering Team Efficiency."
description: 'According to the 2020 State of the Octoverse "Small Pull Requests drive innovation and productivity. Teams that focus on small pull requests and closer collaboration have better reviews and faster feedback. Throughout the year, developers stepped up their work by keeping pull requests at the same size or smaller and merged pull requests up to seven and a half hours faster. This gives developers more time to do the things they love."'

  content : "Having a lot of small repositories is a very common practice in the software development industry, and for a good reason: it gives you a lot of agility. You can have multiple completely different projects running in parallel, each using different dependencies from other projects, and you donâ€™t have to wait for everything to get merged into one monolithic repository before being able to start working again.<br><br>However, at some point, you'll want to apply the same change to every one of your CI environments. To do this manually is time-consuming and tedious. With Gitahxs you can do it in seconds."

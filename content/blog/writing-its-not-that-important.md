In High School, English class was never interesting to me. "I'm good at math and I'm going to be an Engineer or Mathematician, writing is not THAT important." my inner voice would say out loud.

I took AP English during my junior year hoping to do well enough so I wouldn't need to take an English class in college. I remember taking the AP exam; looking up at the clock and seeing there was still an hour left to finish the test; looking down and seeing my pencil on my desk; the sound of pencils as my classmates frantically worked on their essays; wondering if I had a chance of passing the exam since I was the only one done.

Later that summer I got a letter from the College Board, it was the results. It was inconceivable that I scored a three or higher giving me college credit. I already *knew* I would need to take English in college. I opened the letter: *AP English - 3*

I was speechless.

The last English class I ever took was in my senior year of High School. It has been some time since then. I have had two successful Engineering careers and always thought of myself as a slightly above-average writer. Once in a while I would miss a comma. I never REALLY understood when to use a semi-colon. But, overall, I did well enough. At the very least, my writing was not holding me back.

I recently noticed I needed to improve how I express my ideas both at work and in my personal life. I came up with a plan: become a better writer to become a better speaker. I went to Coursera, searched for writing classes and signed up for one titled "Good with Words". I expected the class to be similar to High School: not interesting and hard to grasp. 

> Become a better writer to become a better speaker


I couldn't have predicted that after a few hours I would already be better at writing and excited to learn more. I quickly realized the power of words when you know how to use the right ones effectively. It is no longer an option to slightly above-average, I have to be a better writer if I want to have a more successful career and personal life. The impact is far-reaching: my LinkedIn page, my resume, technical specifications, emails, the list goes on.

This blog is the beginning of my journey to becoming a better writer.
